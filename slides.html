### There isn't a whole lot needed to get started, <br />so you could have an app up and running very quickly.

# Ok, I'm in. Where do I start?

### Once you've figured out what you want to make, you should head to Ionic's [getting started page](http://ionicframework.com/getting-started/).

### This has a short three step walk-through to get Ionic running on your machine.

### There are also some starter apps you can download to get started which saves a lot on time.

# What do I need to run Ionic?

### Ionic is built on Cordova, so you'll need have that installed.

---

# But that's it!

???
Ionic has angular included, so you don't need to worry about installing or requiring it. woo-hoo!

### At this point, I'll jump over to the app I built to show you guys some of the neat stuff Ionic has to offer.
